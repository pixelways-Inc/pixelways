echo FEAT: Implement Pixelway AI Website Builder UI and API placeholders
echo.
echo This commit introduces the foundational UI components for the Pixelway AI Website Builder,
echo including the landing page and the initial workspace layout. It also sets up placeholder
echo API routes for the preview pipeline and a dynamic slug page for site hosting.
echo.
echo Key changes include:
echo - Created `app/builder/page.js` with `TopBadges`, `HeroSection`, `ChatInterfaceLanding`, and `ActionButtons` components.
echo - Created `app/workspace/page.js` utilizing `WorkspaceLayout`, `WorkspaceSidebar`, `WorkspaceTopBar`, `ProjectExplorer`, `DesignMode`, and `PreviewFrame` components.
echo - Implemented `app/api/preview/route.js` and `app/api/build-complete/route.js` as API route placeholders.
echo - Created `app/sites/[site-name]/page.js` as a placeholder for dynamic site hosting.
echo - Integrated `WorkspaceContext` for state management in the workspace.
echo - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude temporary and design-related files.
