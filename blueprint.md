-   **`components/ChatInterfaceLanding.js` (Dark Theme Implementation):**
    -   Modified the `className` of the main `div` (`lovable-container`) to conditionally apply a `dark-mode` class based on the `isDark` state from `ThemeContext`.
    -   Added new CSS rules within the component's `<style jsx>` block, targeting elements under the `.lovable-container.dark-mode` selector. These rules apply dark theme styling (backgrounds, text colors, borders, shadows) to the main container, theme toggle, titles, chat container, buttons, input fields, generating overlay, and suggestion pills.

-   **`components/PixelwaysAdModal.js` (Ad Display Interval):**
    -   Increased the ad display interval from 5 minutes to 10 minutes by changing the default value of the `frequency` prop to `600000`.

-   **`components/HeroSlider.js` (New Component):**
    -   Created a new `HeroSlider` component to display a captivating intro banner slider on the homepage.
    -   Used the `react-slick` library to create the slider.
    -   The slider includes three slides with promotional content, each with a background image, title, description, and a call-to-action button.

-   **`app/page.js` (Homepage Update):**
    -   Replaced the existing hero section with the new `HeroSlider` component.
    -   Removed the `ChatInterfaceLanding` component and the "Features Area" section.

-   **`app/api/auth/github/route.js` (Dynamic Redirect URI):**
    -   Modified the GitHub authentication route to dynamically construct the `REDIRECT_URI` based on the request's origin. This allows the authentication to work in different environments (local, preview, production).
