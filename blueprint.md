## Fix Client Component Error in Client Intake Page (August 13, 2025)

**Objective:** Resolve the build error related to `useState` being used in a Server Component by marking the client intake page as a Client Component.

**Summary of Changes:**

-   **`app/client-intake/page.js`:** Added the `"use client";` directive at the very top of the file to ensure it functions as a Client Component, allowing the use of React Hooks like `useState`.
