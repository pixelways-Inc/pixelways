    -   Imported `contactInfo` from `utility/contactInfo.js`.
    -   Modified `Footer1`, `Footer2`, `Footer3`, `Footer4`, `Footer5`, and `Footer6` components to use contact details from `contactInfo.js` instead of hardcoded values.

**Objective:** Resolve the "Expected ',', got 'const'" syntax error in `app/blog-details/[slug]/page.js` that prevented the build from compiling.

**Summary of Changes:**

-   **`app/blog-details/[slug]/page.js`:**
    -   Added `];` to correctly terminate the `blogPosts` array, which was causing a syntax error due to improper closure before the `BlogDetailsPage` component declaration.
