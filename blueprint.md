## Implement Shop Page Product Display and Dynamic Product Pages (August 12, 2025)

**Objective:** Implement dynamic product display on the shop page and create dynamic product detail pages using provided product data and image API.

**Summary of Changes:**

-   **`data/products.js`:** Created a new file to store product data, including generated slugs and image API URLs for each product.
-   **`components/ProductDetailsContent.js`:** Created a new reusable component to display product details, extracting and adapting the relevant JSX from `app/product-details/page.js`.
-   **`app/shop/[slug]/page.js`:** Created a new dynamic route for product detail pages. This page fetches product data based on the URL slug and renders the `ProductDetailsContent.js` component.
-   **`app/shop/page.js`:** Modified to import and display products from `data/products.js`. Removed all dummy product data from both the sidebar and the main content area. Updated product links to point to the new dynamic product detail pages (`/shop/[slug]`). Removed pagination as there are only 6 products.
-   **`app/product-details/page.js`:** This file is now redundant as its content has been refactored into `components/ProductDetailsContent.js` and the dynamic page is `app/shop/[slug]/page.js`. This file will be deleted.
