## Implement Client Intake Form with Supabase Integration (August 13, 2025)

**Objective:** Implement the client intake form with file upload capabilities and integrate it with Supabase for data storage and file management.

**Summary of Changes:**

-   **`utility/supabaseClient.js`:** Created a new utility file to initialize and export the Supabase client. This file uses environment variables for Supabase URL and anonymous key.
-   **`app/client-intake/page.js`:**
    -   Updated the page to include a comprehensive client intake form with fields corresponding to the `client_intake` database table.
    -   Added functionality for uploading a logo file and multiple other files to Supabase Storage, organizing them into unique folders based on the business name.
    -   Implemented form submission logic to insert form data and file URLs into the `client_intake` table.
    -   Included basic client-side validation and user feedback mechanisms.
