## Team Section and Dynamic Team Slug Page Implementation (August 14, 2025)

**Objective:** Refactor the team section to use a centralized data source, remove dummy data, and implement dynamic team member pages with detailed profiles.

**Summary of Changes:**

-   **`data/teamMembers.js`:** Created a new JavaScript file to store structured data for team members, including bio, contact information, social links, qualifications, and skills. Initialized with data for Etienne Ayuk Ayuk Ndip.
-   **`components/Team.js`:**
    -   Modified to import team member data from `data/teamMembers.js`.
    -   Replaced hardcoded dummy team member entries with a dynamic mapping of `teamMembers` data.
    -   Updated `Link` components to point to dynamic team slug pages (e.g., `/team/[slug]`) instead of a generic `team-details` page.
    -   Ensured only the team member's name and position are displayed on the main team card.
-   **`app/team/[slug]/page.js`:**
    -   Created a new dynamic route page to display individual team member profiles.
    -   Copied and adapted the layout and styling from `app/team-details/page.js`.
    -   Implemented logic to fetch specific team member data based on the `slug` parameter.
    -   Populated the page with detailed information from `teamMembers.js`, including bio, contact details, social links, qualifications, and skill progress bars.
    -   Configured to use `public/team/etienne.jpg` for Etienne's profile picture and the image API for other generic images.
