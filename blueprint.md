## Apply Contact Page Design to Client Intake Page (August 13, 2025)

**Objective:** Align the design and layout of the client intake page with that of the existing contact page for visual consistency.

**Summary of Changes:**

-   **`app/client-intake/page.js`:**
    -   Integrated `TekprofLayout` and `PageBanner` components to match the overall page structure.
    -   Wrapped the form content within a `section` using `contact-form-area` classes for consistent padding and responsiveness.
    -   Applied `col-sm-6` and `col-sm-12` classes to form fields to mimic the two-column and full-width layouts seen on the contact form, improving visual organization.
    -   Removed inline styles and adopted existing CSS classes (`form-group`, `form-control`, `theme-btn`) for form elements to ensure consistent styling with the rest of the application.
