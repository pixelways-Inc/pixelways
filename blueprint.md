**Objective:** Apply a specific CSS class to the 'Client Intake' link in all footer components for styling purposes.

**Summary of Changes:**

## Client Intake Form Enhancements (August 13, 2025)

**Objective:** Enhance the client intake form (`app/client-intake/page.js`) to provide more flexible input options for project type, business type, preferred colors, and to improve the phone number input with country code and auto-detection.

**Summary of Changes:**

-   **`app/client-intake/page.js`:**
    -   Implemented multi-select dropdowns for 'Project Type', 'Business Type', and 'Preferred Colors'.
    -   Added conditional input fields for 'Other' options, allowing users to manually specify types or colors not listed in the dropdowns.
    -   Integrated the `react-phone-number-input` library for the 'Phone Number' field, providing country code selection and auto-detection capabilities.
    -   Updated state management (`useState`) and form handling logic (`handleChange`, `handleSubmit`) to accommodate the new input types and their associated data.
    -   Modified data submission to map 'Business Type' to the 'industry' column in the database for schema compatibility.
    -   Adjusted `PhoneInput` component by removing `className="form-control"` and adding a dynamic `country` prop to improve country flag and code display.

## FIX: Client Intake Form Phone Number Update (August 13, 2025)

**Objective:** Correct the state update logic for the phone number input in the client intake form to prevent incorrect data submission to Supabase.

**Summary of Changes:**

-   **`app/client-intake/page.js`:** Modified the `onChange` handler for the `PhoneInput` component to correctly spread the `formData` object, ensuring that the `phone_number` field is updated without corrupting the state with numeric keys.
