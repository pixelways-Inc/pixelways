## Global Dark Theme Implementation (August 9, 2025)

**Objective:** Implement a site-wide dark theme, specifically using the dark theme characteristics observed in the footer.

**Summary of Changes:**
- **`public/assets/css/style.css`:
  - Introduced new CSS variables (`--main-bg-color`, `--main-text-color`, `--heading-color`, `--secondary-bg-color`, `--global-border-color`) for better theme management.
  - Defined default (light) theme values for these variables.
  - Defined dark theme values for these variables within a `body.dark-theme` selector.
  - Updated existing CSS rules (e.g., for `body`, `h1-h6`, `.list-style-two li`, `.pagination li a`) to use these new theme variables.
- **`layout/TekprofLayout.js`:
  - Added `document.body.classList.add('dark-theme');` within the `useEffect` hook to apply the dark theme class globally to the `<body>` element.

**Next Steps:**
