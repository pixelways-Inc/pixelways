## Handoff Summary: Client Intake Form Enhancement

### Current Goal
The primary goal is to enhance the `app/client-intake/page.js` form by:
1.  Adding project type options with multi-select support.
2.  Adding business type options with multi-select support.
3.  Allowing manual entry for "Other" options for both project and business types.
4.  Allowing multi-select for colors.
5.  Adding country code feature and auto-detection for the phone number field.

### Completed Steps (Attempted)
-   The `app/client-intake/page.js` file was read to understand its structure.
-   A comprehensive `new_string` was prepared to update the component, including:
    -   New state variables (`selectedProjectTypes`, `otherProjectType`, etc.).
    -   Option arrays (`projectTypeOptions`, `businessTypeOptions`, `colorOptions`).
    -   Modified `formData` state.
    -   Updated `handleChange` and new `handleOtherInputChange` functions.
    -   Updated `handleSubmit` logic to save multi-select and "Other" values.
    -   Replacement of input fields with multi-selects and conditional "Other" inputs.
    -   Renaming `industry` to `business_type` in the form.
-   Multiple attempts were made to use the `replace` tool with a large `old_string` (the entire original component) and the prepared `new_string`.

### Problem Encountered
-   Despite the `replace` tool reporting success in some instances, the file `app/client-intake/page.js` has **not** been updated. Subsequent `read_file` calls confirm the file content remains the original version.
-   The most likely cause is a subtle mismatch in the `old_string` provided to the `replace` tool, even though efforts were made to copy it directly from the `read_file` output. The `replace` tool is very sensitive to exact string matches (including whitespace, newlines, etc.).

### Current State of `app/client-intake/page.js`
The file `app/client-intake/page.js` is currently in its **original state** (as read at the beginning of this interaction). No changes have been successfully applied.

### Next Steps for New Model
1.  **Verify File Content:** Start by reading `app/client-intake/page.js` again to ensure its current state.
2.  **Re-attempt `replace` with extreme precision:**
    -   Carefully copy the *entire* content of `app/client-intake/page.js` to use as the `old_string`.
    -   Use the `new_string` provided in the previous turns (which contains all the desired modifications).
    -   Consider breaking down the `replace` operation into smaller, more manageable chunks if a single large `replace` continues to fail. For example, replace the `useState` block first, then the `handleChange` function, then the `handleSubmit`, and finally the JSX.
3.  **Phone Number Feature:** Once the initial form structure changes are applied, proceed with the phone number feature. This will likely involve:
    -   Installing `react-phone-number-input` (confirm with user first).
    -   Importing the library and its CSS.
    -   Replacing the phone number input with the `PhoneInput` component.
    -   Updating `formData` and `handleChange` to work with the `PhoneInput` component.
4.  **Verification:** After each successful modification, verify the changes by reading the file again.
5.  **Commit Changes:** Once all changes are applied and verified, follow the project's Git workflow (stage, commit via `temp_commit.bat`, and push).
